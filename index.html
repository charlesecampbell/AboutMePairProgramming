    <h1>About the Dev</h1>

    <div>

    <p>I'm Tim a 31 year old native Texan, but I've lived in a few different states and I've been to half a dozen countries. I was born in Weatherford, TX, which is 20 miles west of Fort Worth, on September the 6th 1990. At 18 I graduated from Brewer Highschool in White Settlement, TX and joined the Army. I went to basic training in July 2009. After basic training and advanced individual training I was stationed in El Paso at Fort Bliss. In 2010 I deployed to Afghanistan for 12 months. Upon completion of my first deployment I was moved to Fort Hood in Killeen, TX then again to JBLM in WA. I then deployed again to Afghanistan and was there for 6 months before being medivac'd to Germany. I got out of the Army in 2015 with an honorable discharge having served my full contract, and shortly after received my 70% VA disability rating. I worked for a construction company on cell towers, tried my hand at college for a couple of semesters, then finally ended up working for Fireside as a garage door service technician for 5 years. Now I'm an aspiring software dev at Code Fellows and I look forward to joining the tech field.</p>
